# Team-Generator
Application to randomize teams for multiplayer games and record them in google spreadsheet on google drive and DOCX file locally.
It's made for multiplayer games, for example: League of Legends, CS:GO.
Made in Python using:
- gspread for operations on spreadsheets,
- docx for operations on DOCX files,
- PyQt5 for GUI,
- winsound for sounds during generation process,
- time, random, numpy, sys, etc.
Application requires json credentials file to access google spreadsheet, which I won't share due to privacy reasons.
